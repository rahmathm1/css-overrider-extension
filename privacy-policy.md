# Privacy Policy for CSS Overrider

**Last Updated:** November 30, 2024

## Introduction

CSS Overrider ("we", "our", or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our Chrome extension.

## Information Collection and Use

### What We DO NOT Collect

CSS Overrider does **NOT** collect, store, transmit, or share any of the following:

- Personal information (name, email, address, etc.)
- Browsing history
- Website content or data
- User behavior or analytics
- Cookies or tracking data
- IP addresses
- Device information
- Any other personally identifiable information

### What We DO Store (Locally Only)

The extension stores the following information **locally on your device only**:

1. **CSS Rules**: The custom CSS code you create
2. **URL Patterns**: The website URLs or regex patterns you specify for each CSS rule
3. **Extension Settings**: Any preferences you configure

**Important:** All this data is stored using Chrome's local storage API and **never leaves your device**. It is not transmitted to any external servers, cloud services, or third parties.

## How Your Data is Used

The locally stored data is used solely for:

1. Applying your custom CSS rules to matching websites
2. Displaying your saved rules in the extension popup
3. Allowing you to edit or delete your rules

## Data Storage Location

All data is stored locally in your browser using Chrome's `chrome.storage.local` API. This data:

- Remains on your device
- Is not synchronized across devices (unless you enable Chrome Sync, which is controlled by Google)
- Is not accessible to us or any third parties
- Can be deleted at any time by removing the extension

CSS Overrider does **NOT**:

- Use any third-party analytics services
- Connect to any external servers

## Permissions Explanation

The extension requires certain Chrome permissions to function. Here's what each permission is used for:

### Storage Permission

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device:

- We cannot access your data

- Your data is as secure as your Chrome browser and operating system

## Data Retention

## Your Rights and Control

- **Export:** (Future feature) Export your rules for backup

## Children's Privacy

CSS Overrider does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13. Since we don't collect any data at all, the extension is safe for users of all ages.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be:

- Posted on this page
